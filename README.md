# udacity-dand-wrangle-and-analyze-data
For this project Data Analyst Nanodegree students were required to analyze the tweet archive of the Twitter user @dog_rates in order to demonstrate mastery of the data wrangling process.

# the-data-set
Students were given a data set in in several file formats that represented a roughly curated, dirty, and untidy collection of tweets, dog breed productions created by an AI review of tweet photos for each tweet, and additional json formatted data.

# project-motivation
This project was a self-paced review of the data with most emphasis on the gather, assess, and clean steps of the Data Wrangling process. I was required to start from a blank Jupyter Notebook and source data in different file formats from different locations. Later this data was assessed and documented for specific tidiness and quality issues and then cleaned in order to address the issues found.

Once the wrangling process was completed, a short analysis was conducted.
